            <h2>Private Teaching</h2>
            <p>Ryan has been teaching music privately since age 19. While piano students of all ages make up the bulk of his studio, he also teaches voice and organ lessons. His decades of experience teaching an extremely wide variety of students have given him the perspective needed to help anyone become a great musician. </p>
            <p>As a piano teacher, Mr. Murphy accepts students from age six on up. His goals are to help every student sound great at any skill level, primary through emphasis on rhythm, tempo, and note reading. He works best with self-motivated, diligent students. </p>
            <p>Ryan started teaching voice lessons in 2015. Since that time it has become a passion of his. The USA doesn't have a strong singing culture, but Ryan is working to change that through his close attention to form. Attention to breating techniques, resonsance, physical gestures, and phrasing are some of the most integral aspects of his teaching. He teaches students of all ages and has even taught complete novices to match pitch! </p>
            <p>Learning how to play the pipe organ is a monumental endeavor, but one that's very rewarding for anyone with a piano background. Opportunities for part-time work as an organist abound, as do chances to play some of the world's largest and most powerful musical instuments. Ryan has a special interest in advancing the future of the pipe organ through teaching. </p>
